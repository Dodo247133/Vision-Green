# --- Data Acquisition and Merging Guidance ---
# As per GEMINI.md, a direct dataset for this problem is unlikely to be found.
# Therefore, you will need to merge different datasets. Here's a conceptual approach:

# 1.  **Person Detection Datasets:**
#     *   **COCO (Common Objects in Context):** Large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset. Contains bounding box annotations for people.
#     *   **Open Images Dataset:** Another large-scale dataset with object bounding boxes, including people.
#     *   **WIDER FACE:** Specifically for face detection.

# 2.  **Face Recognition Datasets:**
#     *   **Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW):** Dataset for face verification.
#     *   **CelebA (Large-scale CelebFaces Attributes Dataset):** Contains celebrity images with various annotations, useful for face attributes and recognition.
#     *   **VGGFace2:** Large-scale dataset for face recognition.

# 3.  **Trash Classification Datasets:**
#     *   **TrashNet:** A small dataset for classifying trash into 6 categories (cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic, trash).
#     *   **Custom Datasets:** You might need to create or augment datasets by collecting images of various trash types in different environments.

# 4.  **Disposal Analysis (Proper/Improper):**
#     *   This is the most challenging part as pre-existing datasets are rare.
#     *   **Approach 1: Manual Annotation:** You might need to manually annotate videos or images, marking instances of proper and improper trash disposal. This would involve defining what constitutes "proper" (e.g., trash entering a dustbin) and "improper" (e.g., trash thrown on the ground).
#     *   **Approach 2: Synthetic Data Generation:** Potentially generate synthetic data by placing 3D models of trash in various scenes with and without dustbins, simulating disposal actions.
#     *   **Approach 3: Action Recognition Datasets:** Explore action recognition datasets (e.g., Kinetics, UCF101) for actions related to "throwing" or "disposing" and adapt them.

# **Merging Strategy:**
# *   **Unified Format:** Convert all datasets to a unified annotation format (e.g., COCO format, or a custom JSON/XML structure) that includes bounding boxes for people, faces, trash, and labels for trash type and disposal status.
# *   **Data Augmentation:** Apply various data augmentation techniques (rotation, scaling, flipping, color jittering) to increase the diversity and size of your merged dataset.
# *   **Dataset Class:** The `TrashDetectionDataset` class above is a starting point. You would extend it to handle the merged annotations and return appropriate targets for your multi-task model.

# Example of a simple transform
# data_transform = transforms.Compose([
#     transforms.Resize((224, 224)),
#     transforms.ToTensor(),
#     transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
# ])

# To use:
# dataset = TrashDetectionDataset(data_dir='path/to/merged_data', transform=data_transform)
# dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)
