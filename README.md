## High-Level Plan

1.  **Setup Project Structure:** Create the directory structure outlined above.
2.  **Data Acquisition and Preparation:** Find and merge datasets for person detection, face recognition, and trash classification.
3.  **Model Development:**
    *   Develop a person detection and face recognition model.
    *   Develop a trash classification model.
    *   Develop a model to analyze if the trash was disposed of properly.
4.  **API Development:** Create an API to serve the models.
5.  **Web Application Development:**
    *   Develop the user-facing application for registration, dashboard, and issue reporting.
    *   Develop the admin interface for user management and model monitoring.
6.  **Integration and Testing:** Integrate all the components and test the system end-to-end.
